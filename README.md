## Project Overview

### Elevator Pitch

Career Weave transforms the job application process by using AI to analyze job postings and generate perfectly tailored resumes, compelling cover letters, and comprehensive interview strategies. Users can then practice with AI-powered mock interviews featuring realistic voice synthesis, making job preparation more effective and accessible than ever before.

## Project Story

### Inspiration

The job market is increasingly competitive, and generic applications rarely stand out. We recognized that job seekers spend countless hours manually tailoring their applications for each position, often missing key optimization opportunities. Career Weave was born from the idea that AI could not only automate this process but make it significantly more effective by analyzing job requirements at a deeper level than humanly possible.
