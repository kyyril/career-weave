### Elevator Pitch

Career Weave transforms the job application process by using AI to analyze job postings and generate perfectly tailored resumes, compelling cover letters, and comprehensive interview strategies. Users can then practice with AI-powered mock interviews featuring realistic voice synthesis, making job preparation more effective and accessible than ever before.

## üéØ Project Story

### Inspiration

The job market is increasingly competitive, and generic applications rarely stand out. We recognized that job seekers spend countless hours manually tailoring their applications for each position, often missing key optimization opportunities. Career Weave was born from the idea that AI could not only automate this process but make it significantly more effective by analyzing job requirements at a deeper level than humanly possible.

### What We Learned

Building Career Weave taught us valuable lessons about:

- **AI Integration**: Working with multiple AI APIs (Gemini for text generation, ElevenLabs for voice synthesis) and handling their different response formats and rate limits
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Implementing web scraping that works across different job board formats while maintaining reliability
- **User Experience Design**: Creating intuitive workflows that guide users through complex processes without overwhelming them
- **Database Architecture**: Designing schemas that support both structured profile data and flexible AI-generated content
- **Authentication & Security**: Implementing Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase to ensure user data privacy

### How We Built It

**Architecture & Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with serverless functions
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password and Google OAuth
- **AI Services**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for text generation, ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
- **Web Scraping**: Cheerio for job description extraction
- **Deployment**: Netlify with environment variable management

**Development Process:**

1. **Database Design**: Started with a comprehensive schema supporting user profiles, work experiences, projects, skills, AI-generated content, and interview sessions
2. **Authentication Layer**: Implemented secure authentication with proper middleware protection
3. **Profile Management**: Built CRUD interfaces for users to manage their career information
4. **AI Integration**: Developed the "Agent Committee" prompt system that acts as four specialized AI agents working together
5. **Web Scraping Engine**: Created a robust scraper that extracts clean job descriptions from various job boards
6. **Interview System**: Built the mock interview feature with voice synthesis and AI feedback
7. **UI/UX Polish**: Implemented a professional dark theme with smooth animations and responsive design

### Challenges We Faced

**Technical Challenges:**

- **AI Response Consistency**: Gemini sometimes returned responses wrapped in markdown code blocks, requiring robust parsing logic
- **Web Scraping Reliability**: Different job boards have varying HTML structures, necessitating flexible extraction strategies
- **Audio Integration**: Implementing seamless voice synthesis with proper error handling and fallbacks
- **State Management**: Managing complex interview flows with multiple async operations

**Solutions Implemented:**

- Created comprehensive error handling and response validation for all AI interactions
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for both web scraping and audio generation
- Used React's state management effectively with proper loading states and user feedback
- Added extensive logging and monitoring for debugging production issues

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Implemented proper caching strategies for API responses
- Used Next.js dynamic imports for code splitting
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Added loading states and skeleton screens for better perceived performance
